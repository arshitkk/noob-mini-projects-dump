# Disclaimer: 🗑️

Welcome to my **dump** of JavaScript mini-projects! These are noob projects but they’re **mine**, and they helped me learn a lot about coding. I didnt delete them Because deleting these projects felt like throwing away memories. They’re like my coding baby pictures—awkward and messy, but I’m proud of them anyway also they helped me grow as a developer. Feel free to explore, but don’t judge me too harshly— everyone starts somewhere😗!
